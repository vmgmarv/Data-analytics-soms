Data analysis on Soil moisture sensors (SOMS) including prediction to monitor deep seated landslides


This repository is consist of my codes done for Project Dynaslope under the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

The study is about analysing soil moisture data used in monitoring for deep seated landslides in the 50 select sites in the Philippines.

It consists of finding delays of soil moisture sensors with respect to rainfall activities and finding optimal threshold for soil moisture.
